# JAA-BotBackend
JAA-BotBackend is the set of APIs that are required to repsond to the questions that JAA-Bot will have to deal with. 
JAA-Bot is the mechanised replacement for JAA (Human) for many of the questions that take a ludicrous period of time to field, yet add value to the field. In many cases, these are simply a reposnse with a URL and therefore are better repeated by a Bot who will get the URLs more repeatedly correct than I JAA can type.
